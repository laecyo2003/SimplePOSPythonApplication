<h1> Simple POS Python Application </h1>
<h2> A simple POS desktop application based on Python </h2>


<p>
  My goal with this project is to create a full deskto Python application, excluding the database system, which will not be created with Python. It has roots in an old project called <a href="https://github.com/laecyo2003/pdvsimplesl"/> PANDSHIPDV </a>, which is a web-based system (unfinished). However, since I am currently too busy to focus on learning web foundations and I'm studying Python at university, I decided to create a full Python application instead, what will be a such great exercise.
