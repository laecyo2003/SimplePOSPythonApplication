<h1> Simple POS Python Application </h1>
<h2> A simple POS desktop application based on Python </h2>

<p>My goal with this project is to create a full Python Application, excluding a database system, which will not be created with Python. It has roots on an old project, called a href="https://github.com/laecyo2003/pdvsimplesl"/> PANDSHIPDV </a>, which is a web system. But, since I'm very busy at now to learn Web foundations, I tought about create a full Python application, because I am seeing Python on University and it would be a great practice</p>
